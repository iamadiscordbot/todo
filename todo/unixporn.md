i3 Window Manager Overview- https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pSPcQ7Sdoh4

Why use a tiling window manager over a floating one?
I'm currently using a floating one, and while I do sometimes wish I could 'snap' the windows into a corner or side of the screen, I feel like tiling WM's take up precious screen space whether you like it or not, and the lack of being able to resize the window really kills it for me. So, my question is, why use a tiling WM over a floating one, other than for minimalism and less dependencies?

EDIT: Thanks for the quick, and awesome answers. I'm honestly now thinking of trying i3 or i3-gaps.

Let me start this of by saying that I use i3-gaps because it looks and feels amazing.

I used to use floating window managers for a long time, but a year ago or so switched to i3-gaps full time. Why? Because I wanted to like it. I wanted to pimp it out and enjoy it. Was it easy? No, it took determination and patience to get used to.

However, now that I'm used to it I cannot go back. I have so much more control over all my applications now - and for the odd application that I'd like smaller I just toggle floating and resize it.

So - to get to your question: "Why?"

Because it automatically use all my screen estate based on my set rules and limits (which can be adjusted for individual workspaces)

Now, for another question: "How do you make it feel less cramped?"

Well, you have unlimited workspaces to work with. My setup is currently this:

(I switch between these with SUPER+1/2/3/4/5/6)

Workspace #1: 3 terminals, 2 small on the left and 1 on the right.

Workspace #2: Browser.

Workspace #3: Games.

Workspace #4: Misc

And on top of that I usually have a video chat stickied and floating (as in on top on all workspaces) where I chat with my SO.
